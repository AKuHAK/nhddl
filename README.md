# NHDDL — a PS2 exFAT BDM launcher for Neutrino

NHDDL is a memory card-based launcher that scans FAT-formatted BDM devices for ISO files,
lists them and boots selected ISO via Neutrino.

It displays visual Game ID to trigger per-game settings on the Pixel FX line of products and writes to memory card history file before launching the title, triggering per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO 2.

## Why it exists

I have a SCPH-70000 PS2 with internal IDE—microSD mod and RetroGEM installed and I'm tired of dealing with APA-formatted drives.

## What this is not

This not an attempt at making a Neutrino-based Open PS2 Loader replacement.
It __will not__ boot ISOs from anything other than BDM devices.
GSM, PADEMU, IGR and other stuff is out-of-scope of this launcher.

## Usage

Just put the ELF file into Neutrino folder on your memory card and launch it.
By default, NHDDL initializes ATA modules and looks for ISOs on internal HDD.

### Supported BDM devices

NHDDL reuses Neutrino modules for BDM support and requires them to be present in Neutrino `modules` directory.

#### ATA
Make sure that Neutrino `modules` directory contains the following IRX files:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `dev9_ns.irx`
- `ata_bd.irx`

#### MX4SIO
The following files are required for MX4SIO:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `mx4sio_bd_mini.irx`

#### USB
The following files are required for USB:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `usbd_mini.irx`
- `usbmass_bd_mini.irx`

#### UDPBD
The following files are required for UDPBD:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `dev9_ns.irx`
- `smap_udpbd.irx`

UDPBD module requires PS2 IP address to work.
NHDDL attempts to retrieve PS2 IP address from the following sources:
- `udpbd_ip` flag in `nhddl.yml`
- `SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` on the memory card (usually created by w/uLaunchELF)

`udpbd_ip` flag takes priority over `IPCONFIG.DAT`.

See [this](#launcher-configuration-file) section for details on `nhddl.yml`.

### Storing ISO

Just like OPL, NHDDL looks for ISOs in directories named `CD` or `DVD`.
There is no distinction between CD and DVD images, both can be placed in any of those two directories.

### Displaying cover art

NHDDL uses the same file naming convention and file format used by OPL.
Just put **140x200 PNG** files named `<title ID>_COV.png` (e.g. `SLUS_200.02_COV.png`) into the `ART` directory on the root of your HDD.
If unsure where to get your cover art from, check out the latest version of [OPL Manager](https://oplmanager.com).

## Configuration files

NHDDL uses YAML-like files to load and store its configuration options.

### Launcher configuration file

Launcher configuration is read from the `nhddl.yaml` file, which must be located in the same directory as `nhddl.elf`.
This file is completely optional and must be used only to enable 480p or use any device other than ATA.
By default, 480p is disabled and the ATA device is used to look for ISO files.

Example of a valid config file:
```yaml
480p: # if this flag exists and is not disabled, enables 480 output
mode: ata # supported modes: ata (default), mx4sio, udpbd, usb
udpbd_ip: 192.168.1.6 # PS2 IP address for UDPBD mode
```
To disable a flag, you can add `$` before the argument name or just comment it out with `#`.

### Configuration files on storage device

NHDDL stores its Neutrino-related config files in `config` directory in the root of BDM device.

#### lastTitle.txt

To point to the last launched title, NHDDL writes the full ISO path to `lastTitle.txt`.
This file is created automatically.

#### Argument files

These files store arbitrary arguments that are passed to Neutrino on title launch.
For a list of valid arguments, see Neutrino README.

Example of a valid file:
```yaml
# All flags are passed to neutrino as-is for future-proofing, comments are ignored
# Empty values are treated as a simple flag
gc: 2
mc0: mass:/memcard0.bin # file located on HDD
$mc1: mass:/memcard1.bin # disabled argument
# Arguments that don't have a value
dbc:
logo:
```
To disable an argument by default, place a `$` before the argument name.


NHDDL supports two kinds of argument files:

#### global.yaml

Neutrino arguments that need to be applied to every ISO by default are stored in `global.yaml` file

#### Title-specific files

Neutrino arguments that need to be applied to a specific ISO are loaded from either
`<ISO name>.yaml` or `<title ID><anything>.yaml`.

File that has the same name as ISO has the priority.
NHDDL creates this file automatically when title options are modified and saved in UI.

#### BDM device file structure example

`#` marks a comment
