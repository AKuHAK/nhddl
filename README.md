# NHDDL â€” a PS2 exFAT HDD launcher for Neutrino

## What this is
This will be a memory card-based launcher that scans internal exFAT-formatted HDD for ISO files,
lists them and boots selected ISO via Neutrino.

It writes to memory card history file before launching the title, triggering per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO 2.

## What this is not

This not an attempt at making an Open PS2 Loader replacement.  
It __will not__ boot ISOs from anything other than exFAT-formatted internal HDDs.
