# NHDDL — a PS2 exFAT BDM launcher for Neutrino

NHDDL is a memory card-based launcher that scans _FAT/exFAT-formatted_ BDM devices for ISO files,
lists them and boots selected ISO via Neutrino.

It displays visual Game ID to trigger per-game settings on the Pixel FX line of products and writes to memory card history file before launching the title, triggering per-title memory cards on SD2PSX and MemCard PRO 2.

Note that this not an attempt at making a Neutrino-based Open PS2 Loader replacement.
It __will not__ boot ISOs from anything other than BDM devices.
GSM, PADEMU, IGR and other stuff is out-of-scope of this launcher.

## Usage

- Get the [latest Neutrino release](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino/releases)
- Get the [latest `nhddl.elf`](https://github.com/pcm720/nhddl/releases)
- Unpack Neutrino release
- Copy `nhddl.elf` to Neutrino folder next to `neutrino.elf`
- _Additional step if you need USB, MX4SIO or UDPBD_:
  Modify `nhddl.yaml` [accordingly](#common-use-cases) and copy it next to `nhddl.elf`
- Copy Neutrino folder to your PS2 memory card.
  Any folder (e.g. `APPS`) will do, it doesn't have to be in the root of your memory card.

Updating `nhddl.elf` is as simple as replacing `nhddl.elf` with the latest version.

### Supported BDM devices

NHDDL reuses Neutrino modules for BDM support and requires them to be present in Neutrino `modules` directory.
These files should already be present in Neutrino release ZIP by default.

By default, NHDDL initializes ATA modules and looks for ISOs on internal FAT/exFAT-formatted HDD, devices other than ATA require additional configuration.
See [this](#launcher-configuration-file) section for details on `nhddl.yml`.

#### ATA
This is the default device mode.
Make sure that Neutrino `modules` directory contains the following IRX files:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `dev9_ns.irx`
- `ata_bd.irx`

#### MX4SIO
The following files are required for MX4SIO:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `mx4sio_bd_mini.irx`

`mode: mx4sio` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

#### USB
The following files are required for USB:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `usbd_mini.irx`
- `usbmass_bd_mini.irx`

`mode: usb` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

#### UDPBD
The following files are required for UDPBD:
- `bdm.irx`
- `isofs.irx`
- `bdmfs_fatfs.irx`
- `dev9_ns.irx`
- `smap_udpbd.irx`

`mode: udpbd` must be present in `nhddl.yaml`.

UDPBD module requires PS2 IP address to work.
NHDDL attempts to retrieve PS2 IP address from the following sources:
- `udpbd_ip` flag in `nhddl.yml`
- `SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` on the memory card (usually created by w/uLaunchELF)

`udpbd_ip` flag takes priority over `IPCONFIG.DAT`.

### Storing ISO

ISOs can be stored almost anywhere on the storage device.
Only directories that start with `.`, `$` and the following directories are ignored:
 - `nhddl`
 - `APPS`
 - `ART`
 - `CFG`
 - `CHT`
 - `LNG`
 - `THM`
 - `VMC`
 - `XEBPLUS`

### Displaying cover art

NHDDL uses the same file naming convention and file format used by OPL.
Just put **140x200 PNG** files named `<title ID>_COV.png` (e.g. `SLUS_200.02_COV.png`) into the `ART` directory on the root of your HDD.
If unsure where to get your cover art from, check out the latest version of [OPL Manager](https://oplmanager.com).

## Configuration files

NHDDL uses YAML-like files to load and store its configuration options.

### Launcher configuration file

Launcher configuration is read from the `nhddl.yaml` file, which must be located in the same directory as `nhddl.elf`.
This file is _completely optional_ and must be used only to enable 480p in NHDDL UI or switch NHDDL mode to something other than `ata`.
By default, 480p is disabled and the ATA device is used to look for ISO files.

To disable a flag, you can just comment it out with `#`.

See [this file](examples/nhddl.yaml) for an example of a valid `nhddl.yaml` file.

### Configuration files on storage device

NHDDL stores and looks for ISO-related config files in `nhddl` directory in the root of your BDM drive.

#### `lastTitle.txt`

This file stores the full path of the last launched title and is used to automatically navigate to it each time NHDDL starts up.
This file is created automatically.

#### `cache.bin`

Contains title ID cache for all ISOs located during the previous launch, making building ISO list way faster.
This file is also created automatically.

#### Argument files

These files store arbitrary arguments that are passed to Neutrino on title launch.
Arguments stored in those files __are passed to `neutrino.elf` as-is__.

_For a list of valid arguments, see Neutrino README._

Example of a valid argument file:
```yaml
# All flags are passed to neutrino as-is for future-proofing, comments are ignored
gc: 2
mc0: mass:/memcard0.bin # all file paths must always start with mass:
$mc1: mass:/memcard1.bin # this argument is disabled
# Arguments that don't have a value
# Empty values are treated as a simple flag
dbc:
logo:
```

To be able to parse those arguments and allow you to dynamically enable or disable them in UI,
NHDDL uses a dollar sign (`$`) to mark arguments as enabled or disabled by default.
Only enabled arguments get passed to Neutrino.

NHDDL supports two kinds of argument files:

#### global.yaml

Arguments stored in `nhddl/global.yaml` are applied to every ISO by default.

#### ISO-specific files

Arguments stored in `nhddl/<ISO name>.yaml` are applied to every ISO that starts with `<ISO name>`.

NHDDL can create this file automatically when title compatibility modes are modified and saved in UI.

#### Example of directory sturcture on BDM device

```
ART/ # cover art, optional
  |
  - SLUS_200.02_COV.png
nhddl/
  |
   - lastTitle.txt # created automatically
   - cache.bin # created automatically
   - global.yaml # optional argument file, applies to all ISOs
   - Silent Hill 2.yaml # optional argument file, applies only to ISOs that start with "Silent Hill 2"
CD/
  |
   — Ridge Racer V.iso
DVD/
  |
   - Silent Hill 2.iso
   - TimeSplitters.iso
```

## Common use cases

### Switching NHDDL to USB mode

To switch NHDDL to USB mode, you'll need to create `nhddl.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
mode: usb
```
Copy this file to Neutrino directory next to `nhddl.elf`.

### Switching NHDDL to MX4SIO mode

To switch NHDDL to MX4SIO mode, you'll need to create `nhddl.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
mode: mx4sio
```
Copy this file to Neutrino directory next to `nhddl.elf`.

### Switching NHDDL to UDPBD mode

To switch NHDDL to UDPBD mode, you'll need to create `nhddl.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
mode: udpbd
udpbd_ip: <PS2 IP address>
```

If you've previously set up the network via uLaunchELF and your memory card
has `SYS-CONF/IPCONFIG.DAT` file, you don't have to add `udpbd_ip`.

Copy this file to the Neutrino directory next to `nhddl.elf`.
